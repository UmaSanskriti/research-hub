## What Is Research Hub?

Research Hub is a smart research management system that helps you discover papers, explore researcher networks, and make sense of the ever-growing academic landscape. Think of it as your personal research librarian, powered by AI.

### The Problem We Solve

As a researcher, you know these challenges well:

- 📚 **Information overload**: Thousands of papers published daily across multiple databases
- 🔍 **Scattered sources**: Jumping between Google Scholar, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex, and institutional libraries
- 🤝 **Finding collaborators**: Difficult to discover researchers working on related topics
- 📊 **Understanding impact**: Hard to track citation networks and influential work
- ⏰ **Time-consuming**: Literature reviews take weeks of manual searching and organizing
- 🧩 **Missing connections**: Can't easily see how papers and researchers relate to each other

### How Research Hub Helps

Research Hub automatically gathers, enriches, and organizes research information so you can focus on what matters: your research.

## Key Features

### 🔎 Comprehensive Paper Search

Search and discover papers from multiple academic databases in one place:
- Semantic Scholar (computer science, AI, neuroscience)
- OpenAlex (broad coverage across all disciplines)
- Crossref (DOI registry with extensive metadata)

**What this means for you:** No more switching between databases. One search, complete results.

### 📖 Rich Paper Details

For each paper, you get:
- **Full abstracts** (even when one database doesn't have it, we fetch from others)
- **Complete author lists** with affiliations
- **Citation counts** to gauge impact
- **Publication venues** and dates
- **Keywords** for quick topic identification
- **DOIs and permanent links** for reliable access

**What this means for you:** Everything you need to evaluate a paper's relevance, at a glance.

### 👥 Researcher Profiles

Explore detailed profiles for every researcher:
- **h-index** to understand research impact
- **Institutional affiliations** (current and historical)
- **ORCID integration** for verified identity
- **Publication history** with full citation metrics
- **Research interests** and expertise areas
- **Collaboration networks** showing who works with whom

**What this means for you:** Find potential collaborators, understand research lineages, and identify key voices in your field.

### 🕸️ Network Visualization

See the connections between researchers and papers:
- Interactive graphs showing co-authorship networks
- Citation relationships between papers
- Research communities and clusters
- Collaboration patterns over time

**What this means for you:** Discover hidden connections, identify research communities, and understand how ideas flow through your field.

### 💬 AI Research Assistant

Chat with our AI assistant about your research:
- Ask questions about papers in your collection
- Get summaries of research trends
- Find connections between different papers
- Receive suggestions for related work

**What this means for you:** Like having a research assistant who's read everything in your library and can answer questions instantly.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is my research data private?
Yes. Your research library is stored locally and is not shared with anyone unless you explicitly choose to export or share it.

### Do I need to pay for API access to academic databases?
No. We use free, publicly accessible APIs from Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex, and Crossref.

### Can I export my data?
Yes. You can export your paper collection, researcher profiles, and notes in standard formats (CSV, JSON, BibTeX).

### How often is the data updated?
Citation counts and researcher profiles are refreshed whenever you view them, ensuring you always have current information.

### What if a paper isn't in any database?
You can manually add papers with basic metadata. The system will still help you organize and connect them to your other research.

### Can multiple people use the same Research Hub?
Currently, Research Hub is designed for individual use. Team features are on our roadmap.

## A Note from the Developers

Research Hub was built by researchers, for researchers. We understand the frustration of scattered information, incomplete metadata, and time wasted on manual data entry. Our goal is to give you back that time so you can focus on what matters: advancing knowledge in your field.

We believe research should be about asking great questions and finding answers, not wrestling with databases and citation formats. Research Hub is our contribution to making that vision real.

**Happy researching! 🚀**
